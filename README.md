All the code from Larry's Lumber Landing.

Everything works as intended except for the score counter and highscore. While they work in counting the score, they do not display correctly in the game. I put in a debugger that shows in the console as the score goes p to show it works but it doen't display in game correctly.

My game was very similar to what i had planned out on my one pager. The only real difference is the assets I used. I couldn't find a good lumberjack asset so istead of having aliens attacking Larry on earth, I had Larry go to space and attempt to take the aliens wood while they defend their home.
